## Collections
- **CountedMap** is data structure which is counting the number of occurences of a given key inside a collection of keys.

## Distances
- **Jaccard** computes the *Jaccard* similarity between two collections.


## Test coverage
To get the test coverage, I use the [grcov](https://github.com/mozilla/grcov#how-to-get-grcov).
See the instructions [steps](https://github.com/mozilla/grcov#example-how-to-generate-source-based-coverage-for-a-rust-project).
